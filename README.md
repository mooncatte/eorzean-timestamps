# eorzean timestamps

for fishers and people who don't want to be reminded of the passage of time in reality.


## what it do

the vanilla ffxiv client has an option to turn on timestamps for your chatlog, but it can only print either local or server time. this plugin will either override that function to print only in eorzea time, or append eorzean time to the existing timestamp so you have both.


## what is the point of this?

its main usecase is for fishing. with a macro indicating when you cast you will know what time you threw your line or used a lure skill in, thus determining the eligible fish that can bite should the time and/or weather roll over. it's also useful for knowing when your intuition fell off, if you're doing discovery reporting.

if you like it and you don't fish that's cool too! but also you should fish it's fun
